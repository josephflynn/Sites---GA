# Introduction To Programming

The computer will do what you tell it to do.

---


## What is a Program

A __program__ is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do

---


## What Is Programming

__Programming__ is the task of writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand.

---


## Becoming A Programmer

* It isn't about the programming language. It is about changing how you think.
* We have to know how the computer thinks to change how we think.

---


## How Computers 'Think'

* The short answer is that they don’t think.
* The slightly longer answer is that while computers don’t think, they act as if they do, by sequentially executing simple instructions.
* The only things a computer knows are the things we tell it.

---


## Solving problems

* Computers don't do anything on their own.
* They can solve problems, but only if they've been told to.
* There are a million different ways to solve any one problem.
* It is up to the programmer to define what the solution is and the steps required for the machine to perform to achieve it.
* However before we start coding, it's a good idea to plan the solution first.

---


## Pseudo Code

* Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language.
* Focus on producing the correct solution and sequence of steps, or Algorithm.

Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs. For example,
If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the door

## What Is JavaScript?

* General Programming language developed by Brenden Eich at Netscape in 10 days in 1995
* Standardised under the name ECMAScript (Latest is ES6)
* Used to control behaviour and interact with the user on the web

```
function hello(name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
};

var hello_world = hello("world");

console.log(hello_world);
```
